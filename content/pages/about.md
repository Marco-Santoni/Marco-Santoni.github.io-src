Title: about

I am passionate about data science and software engineering, and I am lucky to have turned them into my daily work. Always driven by curiosity and by an attitude for learning, I enjoy working both on the fa√ßade and on the foundations of a data product, ranging from machine learning to data engineering, devops, and data intensive architectures.

I co-host the [Intervista Pythonista](https://intervistapythonista.com/) podcast about the Python ecosystem. We run bi-weekly interviews to Pythonistas in the Italian community about backend development, data science, automation and scientific research.
