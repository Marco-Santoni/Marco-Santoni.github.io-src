Title: bookshelf

As I mostly read e-books, I don't have a physical bookshelf at home. I decided to build a digital bookshelf here to keep track of what I'm reading over the years (novels are not listed here). I won't write reviews here, but I'll just place  a "**♥**" next to the books definitely worth reading.
