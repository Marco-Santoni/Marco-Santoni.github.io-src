I have been working with charts and business intelligence in the last 5 years. When you spend time building business reports, you may perceive data visualization as a cold technical and business tool. However, there are **6 hidden gems** in data visualization that I found by chance. I realized data visualization is not as cold as I thought. Let me recap for you these 6 gems.

## The first chart ever

William Playfair was a Scottish engineer and political scientist from the 18th century. He is considered as the author of the very first chart:

The chart was published back in 1786. It shows the volumes of imports and exports of Scotland over one year on a scale of 10k pounds. Each country is given two bars: one for volume of imports, one for volume of exports.

I am so used to seeing bar charts that I never asked myself who was the inventor or when they first appeared. It's nice to find out that the have been invented way before the invention of calculators and that they have changed so little since then.

## The best graphic ever

Charles Minard represented 6 types of data about Napoleon's 1812 Russia campaign in one single chart. This visual was considered by [Edward Tufte](https://www.nationalgeographic.com/culture/article/charles-minard-cartography-infographics-history) as "_the best statistical graphic ever produced_".

Minard represented in two dimensions [six types](https://ageofrevolution.org/200-object/flow-map-of-napoleons-invasion-of-russia/) of data: the number of Napoleon's troops; distance; temperature; the latitude and longitude; direction of travel; and location relative to specific dates.

## Non-neutral scales

Is data visualization a neutral discipline? Not really. Basic decisions like the choice of scale or of the limit of axes might change radically the information perceived by the reader.
