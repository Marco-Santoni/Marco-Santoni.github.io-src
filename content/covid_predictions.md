The first Covid case in Italy was found on February 21st 2020. A couple of weeks later we were entering the lock down with these numbers.

The number of Covid-19 new cases was growing really fast every day. We had no clue about what was going to happen and about when it would have ended. Was it going to end soon? How quickly was the virus spreading? I was wondering whether our feeling and **expectations** would have turned out to be true or not. So, I run a little **experiment** with 7 friends. I asked each of them the following 2 questions on March 10th 2020:

1. What will the total number of Covid19 cases be by April 1st?
2. When will the first day with a number of new cases smaller than 50?

The goal of these questions was to investigate our ability as humans to nearly understand the size and the duration of such an unseen event like a global pandemy. Let's plot the answers we gave to the 1st questions.

## Total cases by April 1st

The total number of Covid19 cases in Italy was `110574`. These were our 7 prediction made on March 10th.
