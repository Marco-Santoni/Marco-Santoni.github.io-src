I'm now part of a data and AI team in a fintech spinoff. When I joined the company, it did not make sense to spend time in job titles because we were to build everything from scratch (both software, teams and organization). My job title was therefore a generic "_AI Practitioner_". One year later, teams and responsibilities are more or less clear, and it is now time to define my job title.

## What was I doing till now?

I started my career in 2013 as "_Data Scientist and Software Developer_" (what we would call today a _Machine Learning Engineer_?). I was then defined as an "_Associate_" when working as a data scientist in a consulting firm. In the last 3 years, I worked in a manufacturing firm as "_Data Scientist_" first and as "_Digital Factory Dev Lead_" in the last year.
