I've been speaking at Codemotion for the first time in October 2025 thanks to the work done over the last months at TeamSystem. With my colleague Mattia De Leo, we presented our recent work on building AI assistants based on knowledge graphs and large language models. The talk was well received, and we had a lot of interesting questions from the audience.

I focused my talk on Text2SQL, a task that consists of translating natural language queries into SQL queries. This is a challenging task, and I explained why understanding the semantics of the natural language query and the structure of the database schema is not enough. Business context and further metadata are key to generate accurate SQL queries.
