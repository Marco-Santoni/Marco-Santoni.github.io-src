One of the key decisions to take when building a data science team is the **mix of roles**. This means choosing the right mix of background and of activities that each member of the team should have. I'll compare two models of teams I've experienced so far and define them as **chess-team** model and **checkers-team** model.

## Chess-Team Model

The chess-team model is the common model we read about in literature. In a chess-team, each member of the team has a **specific role**. Roles are usually: _data engineers_, _data scientists_, and _machine learning engineers_. These roles correspond to different set of skills (math and statistics vs coding and devops) and to different set of activities (model selection vs data preparation vs model deployment).

Similarly to a chess piece which has a clear role that is different from the other pieces, a member of a data science chess-team is assigned a subset of tasks in the development pipeline. Let's consider a simplistic development pipeline:

- data extraction
- model development
- model deployment

The three activities of this development pipelines correspond to the three rolesof the team, and there is little space for confusion. A data engineer probably won't work a lot on the model development and selection.
