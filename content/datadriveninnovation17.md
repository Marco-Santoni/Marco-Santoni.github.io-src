I gave a talk at [Data Driven Innovation](http://2017.datadriveninnovation.org/) about the specific challenges when doing data science in manufacturing. I introduced the approach to data science that we are deploying at [Brembo](http://www.brembo.com/en). The talk was part of a track dedicated to Industry 4.0 and to IoT.
