[Designing Data-Intensive Applications](https://dataintensive.net/) was not a quick-read. Let me be clear, it is not such a long book (the paper version is 400 pages). The book covers a broad spectrum of data technologies and is dense of information in each paragraph. So, be ready before starting the journey.

What did I learn from the book? I'll take few quotes from my notes.

> An architecture that is appropriate for one level of load is unlikely to cope with 10 times that load. If you are working on a fast-growing service, it is therefore likely that you will need to rethink your architecture on every order of magnitude load increase â€” or perhaps even more often than that.
