I've been for the first time at Big Data London in September 2025. I gave a talk with my colleague Andrea Romeo about a challenging task we faced at TeamSystem. We developed an offloading of thousands of SQL Server tenants via CDC (Change Data Capture) to a data lake via Debezium.

I appreciated the conference which I consider close te being actually a fair. It was a great chance to meet key vendors in the big data space and to discuss with them about their products.
