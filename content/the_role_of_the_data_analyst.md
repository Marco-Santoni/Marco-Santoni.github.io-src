When you work as a data analyst or data scientist in a company, you may not be training predictive models every single day. A significant (and often interesting) part of your job is answering business questions via data mining regardless if you do it with machine learning, descriptive statistics or whatever. You may start with a business question like:

> why are our revenues increasing in the last quarter?

> what are common patterns between our loyal customers?

Such simple questions often require a complex work that goes beyond knowing well statistics. You need to know how how your business work and what are the expectations of your stakeholder.

## What the analyst enjoys the most (and the least)

Once a business question has arrived, where do we start from? Most data analysts would start mining into the **data exploration** phase. This phase is usually the first of this activity, and the data analysts looks into distributions and patterns in the data. The goal here is to get a good comprehension of the data we are sitting on. And usually the data analysts has fun during this data exploration time.ðŸŽ‰ðŸ™Œ He or she is playing with charts and with some statistics of the dataset.

What does the data analyst usually **not** enjoy doing? ðŸ‘ŽðŸ˜­ Based on my experience, preparing the **presentation** of the analysis is the part of the activity that most data analysts enjoy the least. And what does it imply?

Imagine you have **10 days** to work on this data analysis before the meeting with your stakeholders. As our dear data analysts enjoy playing with the data more than playing with PowerPoint, they would probably spend 9 days on mining the data and 1 day working on the presentation. And probably the 9 days do not depend on the actual complexity of the task. If the business question can be answerend in 5 days with some basic descriptive statistics, the data analysts would probably investe more and more time trying some more advanced modelling technique or some more fancy data visualization. Why? Because they enjoy it. So, the data analysis part of the activity fills all the available space like a gas in a room would do.

Last day (if not very last hours) is usually left to working on the presentation.

## The wrong interpretation of the role

This looked fine to me until
