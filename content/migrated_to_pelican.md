Title: Blog Migrated to Pelican on GitHub Pages

I have migrated my blog. It is built under [Pelican](http://blog.getpelican.com/), a static site generator. It allows me to write posts as plain markdown or even Jupyter notebooks. I then use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) to version and publish the blog. I am continuing to use [Aruba](https://www.aruba.it/home.aspx) as domain provider. It is sufficient to rename the `CNAME` and the `ANAME` variables to hide the blog under the `marcosantoni.com` domain.

The migration [from Wordpress to Pelican](http://mathamy.com/migrating-to-github-pages-using-pelican.html) was sped up by the `pelican-import` plugin. [This blog post](https://fedoramagazine.org/make-github-pages-blog-with-pelican/) is a good reference for deploying a Pelican blog on GitHub Pages
