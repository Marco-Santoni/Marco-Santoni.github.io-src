I was invited to give a talk at Politecnico di Milano at Osservatorio Big Data. The event took place on November 4th, 2025, and I my talk was _"Guida galattica per data product AI-ready"_, which means _"Hitchhiker's guide to AI-ready data products"_.

I shared the experience we had at TeamSystem in building data products that are enablers for text2SQL agents. These agents require high quality context about the data they are querying. This context is not only about the schema of the database but also about business rules, data quality, and other metadata that can help the agent to generate accurate SQL queries.

We deveoped a platform that integrates the metadata of our data products the the context of our text2SQL agents. The idea is to build the metadata once only and reuse it across different uses cases (both AI agents and traditional data consumers).
