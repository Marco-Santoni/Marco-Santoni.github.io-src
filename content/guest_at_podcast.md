I was recently guest at a new podcast called "DaGrande". The podcast was launched by [Stefano Bosisio](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stefano-bosisio1/) and aims at helping students that are near to conclude their studies. "DaGrande" consists of a series of interviews where professionals from a variety of industries share tips or insights abuot career that they would have loved to hear when they were younger (eg when still at university).

I was the one interviewed in the second episode (see below), and I shared my advices for starting a career in the Data and AI world.
