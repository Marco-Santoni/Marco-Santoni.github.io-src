On May 2021, the first episode of my podcast went live. The podcast is called [Intervista Pythonista](http://intervistapythonista.com/) and is co-hosted with [Cesare Placanica](https://it.linkedin.com/in/cesare-placanica). Cesare and I are members of the [Python Milano](http://milano.python.it/) community that helped us to kick-off the idea.

## Why podcasting?

I am a heavy podcast listener. I love podcasts because they are valuable conversations on topics I love. These conversations let me hear the points of view of experts in the field and stay up to date with new trends.

I prefer podcasts over videos for two reasons. First, I can listen to them while I'm doing something else (usually low-attention tasks like dish-washing or running). Second, I don't need to sit in front of a screen after I've been working for some hours like that.

## Why now?
