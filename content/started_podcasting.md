Title: How I started podcasting

On May 2021, the first episode of my podcast went live. The podcast is called [Intervista Pythonista](http://intervistapythonista.com/) and is co-hosted with [Cesare Placanica](https://it.linkedin.com/in/cesare-placanica). Cesare and I are members of the [Python Milano](http://milano.python.it/) community that helped us to kick-off the idea.

## Why podcasting?

I am a heavy podcast listener. I love podcasts because they are dense conversations on topics I love. These conversations let me hear the points of view of experts in the field and stay up to date with new trends.

I prefer podcasts over videos for two reasons. First, I can listen to them while I'm doing something else (usually low-attention tasks like dish-washing or running). Second, I don't need to sit in front of a screen after I've been working daily for 8+ hours still in front of a screen.

## Why now?

Cesare and I participated as panelists in a [community talk](https://talks.codemotion.com/panel-online---stories-of-python-and-dat) at last Codemotion conference. The panel was an informal discussion on topic like data team organization, learning tips, and latest trends in data science.

We had a surprisingly high number of attendees during the panel. I noticed that an informal chat between experts is a content that people were enjoying more than I expected. I suspect that people miss the **informal chat** they used to have during in-person meetups and conferences (ie suspended since the beginning of the pandemics).

So, I got back to Cesare with the idea:

> Why don't we start podcasting?

Cesare was like "tell me more about it"
