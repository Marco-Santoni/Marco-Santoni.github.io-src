I had a lot of fun (and work) over the last 6 months working or organizing a conference, Py4AI. The conference was held in Pavia, Italy, on March 16th 2024. The conference was a success, with over 200 attendees and 12 speakers. The conference was organized by a group of volunteers, including myself, Alessandro Ferrari, Pietro Peterlongo, Cesare Placanica, Thao Hoang, and Luca Baggi. A screenshot with the speakers lineup:
